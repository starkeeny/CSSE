# CSSE
C# Script Environment. 

This shell application is designed to be a manager for super small scripts using the engine of http://www.csscript.net/ 
and is recommended to be used with https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ as editor (configure this application as standard 
application for *.cs-files) with the matching csscript-plugin.

A stable version of csscript is provided in the deploy folder for a simplified download only, but is else out of scope of this project.
